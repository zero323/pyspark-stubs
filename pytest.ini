# Where do the test cases come from?  We provide our own collection
# logic by implementing `pytest_pycollect_makeitem` in mypy.test.data;
# the test files import that module, and pytest sees the magic name
# and invokes it at the relevant moment.  See
# http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/writing_plugins.html#collection-hooks

# Both our plugin and unittest provide their own collection logic,
# So we can disable the default python collector by giving it empty
# patterns to search for.
# Note that unittest requires that no "Test*" classes exist.
