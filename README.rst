PySpark Stubs
=============

|Build Status| |PyPI version| |Conda Forge version|

A collection of the Apache Spark `stub
files <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#stub-files>`__. These
files were generated by
`stubgen <https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/master/mypy/stubgen.py>`__
and manually edited to include accurate type hints.

Tests and configuration files have been originally contributed to the
`Typeshed project <https://github.com/python/typeshed/>`__. Please refer
to its `contributors
list <https://github.com/python/typeshed/graphs/contributors>`__ and
`license <https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/LICENSE>`__ for
details.

Important
----------

This project `has been merged <https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/31a16fbb405a19dc3eb732347e0e1f873b16971d#diff-23eeeb4347bdd26bfc6b7ee9a3b755dd>`_  with the main Apache Spark repository (`SPARK-32714 <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32714>`_). All further development for Spark 3.1 and onwards will be continued there.

For Spark 2.4 and 3.0, development of this package will be continued, until their official deprecation.

- If your problem is specific to Spark 2.3 and 3.0 feel free to create an issue or open pull requests here.
- Otherwise, please check `the official Spark JIRA <https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SPARK/issues/>`_ and `contributing guidelines <https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html>`_. If you create a JIRA ticket or Spark PR related to type hints, please ping me with `[~zero323] <https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=zero323>`_ or `@zero323 <https://github.com/zero323>`_ respectively. Thanks in advance.

Motivation
----------

-  Static error detection (see
   `SPARK-20631 <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-20631>`__)

   |SPARK-20631|

-  Improved autocompletion.

   |Syntax completion|

Installation and usage
----------------------

Please note that the guidelines for distribution of type information is
still work in progress (`PEP 561 - Distributing and Packaging Type
Information <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0561/>`__). Currently
installation script overlays existing Spark installations (``pyi`` stub
files are copied next to their ``py`` counterparts in the PySpark
installation directory). If this approach is not acceptable you can add stub
files to the search path manually.

According to `PEP
484 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#storing-and-distributing-stub-files>`__:

    Third-party stub packages can use any location for stub storage.
    Type checkers should search for them using PYTHONPATH.

Moreover:

    Third-party stub packages can use any location for stub storage.
    Type checkers should search for them using PYTHONPATH. A default
    fallback directory that is always checked is
    shared/typehints/python3.5/ (or 3.6, etc.)

Please check usage before proceeding.

The package is available on `PYPI <https://pypi.org/project/pyspark-stubs/>`__:

.. code:: bash

    pip install pyspark-stubs

and `conda-forge <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyspark-stubs>`__:

.. code:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge pyspark-stubs

Depending on your environment you might also need a type checker, like `Mypy`_
or `Pytype`_ [#f1]_, and autocompletion tool, like `Jedi`_.

This package is tested against MyPy development branch and in rare cases (primarily important upstrean bugfixes), is not compatible with the preceding MyPy release.

PySpark Version Compatibility
-----------------------------

Package versions follow PySpark versions with exception to maintenance releases - i.e. `pyspark-stubs==2.3.0` should be compatible with `pyspark>=2.3.0,<2.4.0`.
Maintenance releases (`post1`, `post2`, ..., `postN`) are reserved for internal annotations updates.

API Coverage:
-------------

As of release 2.4.0 most of the public API is covered. For details please check `API coverage document <https://github.com/zero323/pyspark-stubs/blob/master/doc/api-coverage.rst>`__.
